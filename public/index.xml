      <description>It seems that we Belgians just love confusing foreigners…
Imagine wanting to take a train to Mons from Ghent but there only is one driving to Bergen. Or driving south with a GPS telling you to follow the direcion of Liège, but for a while you will only see signs to Luik.
Mons/Bergen, Liège/Luik, Ypres/Ieper… those names refer to exactly the same city - one of them is the official French name, the other one the official Dutch one.</description>

      <description>What I was wondering: are there still Joke&amp;rsquo;s born in Belgium? Every time I pass by a colleague named Joke, I wonder. Let me explain: Joke is quite regular Dutch first name for a girl. You pronounce it [yo-ke], like blending &amp;lsquo;yoghurt&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;kebab&amp;rsquo; together and put the accent on the &amp;lsquo;yo&amp;rsquo;. &amp;lsquo;Joke&amp;rsquo; is just a diminutive form of Jo, kind of like Jenny, Abby and Debby. No-one who grew up speaking Dutch would bat an eye to hear about someone named Joke, but everyone else on this planet probably would.</description>
