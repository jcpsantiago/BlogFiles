      <description>Sometimes you dream big, but you just don&amp;rsquo;t have the data&amp;hellip;
I had this plan for text analysis by character from the Parks &amp;amp; Recreation series to celebrate Galentine&amp;rsquo;s Day but getting the data was a struggle. Subtitles are available for pretty much every episode but those don&amp;rsquo;t contain data about the character who said the lines. I needed scripts, which are a bit harder to come by. I found 6 scripts of episodes scattered on the web from the first 3 seasons in pdf format that were usable.</description>
