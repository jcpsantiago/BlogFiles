      <description>I was busy on a little side project on radio playlists when the news broke about the death of Dolores Oâ€™Riordan, front singer of The Cranberries. And sure enough, a few hours later I could see The Cranberries starting to pop up in the playlists.
Their second album No Need to Argue was one of my favourite CD&amp;rsquo;s as a teenager, and so I wondered: how many times would they be played?</description>

      <description>At the end of the year, everyone is making lists. And radio stations are no exceptions.
Many of our radio stations have a weekly &amp;ldquo;people&amp;rsquo;s choice&amp;rdquo; music chart. Throughout the week, people submit their top 3 recent songs, and every week those votes turn into a music chart. At the end of the year, they collapse all those weekly charts into a larger one covering the entire year.</description>
