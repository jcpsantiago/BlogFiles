      <description>Sometimes you dream big, but you just don&amp;rsquo;t have the data&amp;hellip;
I had this plan for text analysis by character from the Parks &amp;amp; Recreation series to celebrate Galentine&amp;rsquo;s Day but getting the data was a struggle. Subtitles are available for pretty much every episode but those don&amp;rsquo;t contain data about the character who said the lines. I needed scripts, which are a bit harder to come by. I found 6 scripts of episodes on the web from the first 3 seasons in pdf format that were usable.</description>

      <description>I was busy on a little side project on radio playlists when the news broke about the death of Dolores Oâ€™Riordan, front singer of The Cranberries. And sure enough, a few hours later I could see The Cranberries starting to pop up in the playlists.
Their second album No Need to Argue was one of my favourite CD&amp;rsquo;s as a teenager, and so I wondered: how many times would they be played?</description>

      <title>Any Joke&#39;s left in Belgium?</title>

      <description>What I was wondering: are there still Joke&amp;rsquo;s born in Belgium? Every time I pass by a colleague named Joke, I wonder. Let me explain: Joke is quite regular Dutch first name for a girl. You pronounce it [yo-ke], like blending &amp;lsquo;yoghurt&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;kebab&amp;rsquo; together and put the accent on the &amp;lsquo;yo&amp;rsquo;. &amp;lsquo;Joke&amp;rsquo; is just a diminutive form of Jo, kind of like Jenny, Abby and Debby. No-one who grew up speaking Dutch would bat an eye to hear about someone named Joke, but everyone else on this planet probably would.</description>
