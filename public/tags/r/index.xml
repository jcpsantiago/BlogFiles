      <description>I went through the entire dplyr documentation for a talk last week about pipes, which resulted in a few &amp;ldquo;aha!&amp;rdquo; moments. I discovered and re-discovered a few useful functions, which I wanted to collect in a few blog posts so I can share them with others.
This first post will cover ordering, naming and selecting columns. The next post will be about recoding and transforming columns, and after that I will move on to row selection.</description>
